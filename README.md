 In this project we will create a complete process for predicting stock prices. We will achieve some pretty good results on NSE Dataset for Nifty-50 (https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/nse-stocks-database). For that purpose we will use a LSTM model, a type of Recurrent Neural Network. We use LSTM for the obvious reason that we are trying to predict time series data.
